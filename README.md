# SurveyAnalysis.jl
This Julia package is created as an open-source alternative for survey analysis and documentation. Inspiration for this package comes from *survey* R package, other survey programs and my professors at the sampling program I recently took.

# Package status

This package is still in *very early development*. Most of the functions aren't written yet! Therefore, this README should be updated along the updates.

# Motivation
The following project has been created after the completion of 2020 Sampling Program for Survey Statisticians at the Institute of Social Research, University of Michigan. I felt that the statistical community could benefit from an open-source package whose sole objective is to create an **end-to-end survey analysis suite** [^1]. This end-to-end survey analysis suite will encompass:

- [ ] Sampling procedures.
- [ ] Assistance in survey design specification.
- [ ] Analysis of complex survey data
- [ ] Survey documentation

# Roadmap and specific projects
This section will be soon be completed. Nevertheless, there are over-arching principles that will guide the package development:

- **Documentation:** If a function, process or procedure isn't documented, **it does not exist**. Coming from audit practice, I understand the importance of documentation.

# How to contribute

This package has to be useful to YOU, therefore I strongly encourage to reach out with the following:

- Tell us your pain points when working in other programs.
- What features do you need for you to transition to this package?
- What documentation requirements do you need? Are there specific regulatory requirements to need to comply?

If possible, please be part of the project by implementing associated functions. Reach out through the issues so we can work something out.

Thanks for reading!

[^1: This is a rather ambitious objective which I do not intend to build alone as a one-man project. Contribution to these project will be greatly appreciated and encouraged.]
